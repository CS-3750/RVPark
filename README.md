 - Hello! I am also in my senior year and will graduate with my Bachelors in Computer Science in the fall. My wife and I are living the dream with our 8 month old son, Leo. He keeps us smiling every day. I have been working for the State of Utah for almost 2 years now, building up the automated testing team. I too enjoy rock climbing (if you count bouldering indoors ðŸ˜‚), camping, hiking, and watching movies. If you ever see me in person, I will be wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and one of my fare to many pairs of Teva sandals.
