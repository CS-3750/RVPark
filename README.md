- Kade Angell
 - Hi! This is my final course in my CS undergrad (mostly completed at Utah State University), and I will be starting my MS in Computer Science at Colorado State University in the fall. I'm working on the airborne software team at Beta Technologies this summer in Burlington, Vermont. I interned for them last summer as well, and with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory the summer before. I generally rock climb several times per week and tend to keep myself busy with personal projects.
